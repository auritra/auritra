G'day mates!

I'm Rafeyin

Let's begin
with a simple request.

Can we forget ab
everything for a moment, look
withinâ€”inwards,and ask
ourselves

    what do we really wanna do:
      in this world?
    why don't we try:
       think it through
        - the simplest way?
    can we?
       for a moment, please?
    or can we?

More pressingly,
Can we just take a moment
- to find outâ€”this one piece

     THE MISSING KEY
  
- to unlock a flow of energy, emanating
   â€¢ from the mindâ€”extending
   â€¢ through the body
   â€¢ to the groundâ€”connecting
   â€¢ to the Earth: the planetâ€”this world

  that makes us ask ourselves
  
    â€¢ What were we born to do?
    â€¢ What do we really wanna do?
    â€¢ What do I REALLY WANNA DO?

Whilst you do you as your mileage may vary, must you never forget you know whyâ€”you know
    
    a: WHAT YOU WANNA DO?
    b: WHY YOU WANNA DO?

    a=f(b): WHY YOU WANNA DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO?
